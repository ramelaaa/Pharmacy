## Receiving and Putting Away
1. Take all totes from the driver, and have the barcodes facing you. Give him the totes from the previous day. Count the totes you have received, count the totes listed on the drivers list and verify the counts are the same. Sign for it.
2. Verify all smart counts (Regular, CIII-CV, and CII) are complete. 
- Scan all totes in RXI>Receiving, some OTC totes may be scanned.
- Scan OTC totes separately if it says "OTC" in MyInventory>Receiving>Receiving by scanning
- Technicians cannot scan CII tote, give it to the pharmacist to receive(Tote Audit message). GIVE ALL controls to the Pharmacist.
- Other totes may require a technician to audit the tote. The scanner will tell you after scanning it. You must enter the last 4 digits of the tote to verify, then scan EACH ITEM EXACTLY ONCE. If an item is MISSING, LET MANAGER KNOW!!
3. Start unpacking totes
- Unpack Refrigerated items first, Big Totes second, smaller totes last
- Any item that is damaged in the totes, TAKE PICTURES AND LET MANAGER KNOW!!!
4. Open the email, print the invoice
- Give the pharmacist all invoices for controls
- OTC and Rx invoices must be stapled separately as they have different folders to be filed in

## OOS (Out of Stock) 
1. Items are listed by last name
2. Go to first item on list
  - If placed before cutoff (4pm, 3pm on Sundays)
    - Check if any other patients in OOS for the same Drug (F2>Ctrl+G)
      - Check on the invoice if an item came in. Open invoice from the email, hit control+F search by drug name or NDC.
      - Check script ndc, annotations, comments
        - If the drug came in, in the correct quantity, release by time in which the script was placed in OOS.
      - If not enough, check abc to check availability and partial it
      - Move onto next item and repeat
  - If drug was placed after cutoff time, it may or may not come in. Check the invoice. 
  - Check scripts that were placed in OOS outside of operating hours(Example 3:00 am) by removing from OSOS to check for a paid claim as these scripts may be auto refill and have no refills, or a patient requested a refill BUT its RTS on insurance.

If the item was listed on invoice but was not received, CALL ABC TO GET BACK CREDIT OR RESEND :(

Pay attention to drugs that are consignment. It takes several days to come in. Call the patient to let them know any check status on RXI. LEAVE COMMENTS!

Check for drugs on the shelf, if it is there, update on hands, release from OOS.

*****If an item did not come in and was placed before cutoff ******
1. Check if there are multiple exceptions on the script (example OOS and WCB). If a script has a WCB exception, the system will not order. Remove from OOS. DO not order the drug until there is an active, valid script.
2. Verify the script is due for a refill and does not need a PA. Check the patient's profile and remove from OOS to verify a PA is not needed. Leave comments when the script was originally placed in OOS. If no TPR, place back into OOS. Becareful that this is not consignment, as removing and replacing items can trigger a double order.
3. Check RXI to see if any pending shipment from anda/smartsource. The item will show confirmed/shipped status. Anything that says  not supplied will now be coming in.
4. Check ABC if available.
5. Call pt and let them know of the delay in getting the drug. If available and the patient needs it urgently, manual order the drug, if let the patient know the drug will be coming in a few business days.

## PFL (Partial Filled)
- Drug must be filled before 4 PM to be ordered automatically(Similar to OOS â†’ 4:00 PM cutoff (3 PM Sundays))
- Scripts are sorted by last name
- If right NDC and quantity:
  - Release
  - If partial not picked up: Remove from bin and return vial to stock. If the partial was picked up, leaflet will indicate a completion
    - If NDC is incorrect:
      - If partial not picked up: Release, change NDC, fill
      - If completion: Release, change NDC, if no TPR,then fill. If TPR(RTS) call the patient to let them know, when they can fill. DO NOT ORDER CORRECT NDC
- If item did not come in,was placed(filled) at before cutoff time, and was not picked up:
  - Release partial and place in OOS (make sure it's available first!) Note: this may result in double order.
- Reminder: check RXI for pending shipments from secondary supplier

Lastly check MSC, but leave controls to the pharmacist. File invoices :)
